## Requirements
In order to facilitate the execution of the backend exercises I have prepared an [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml) file to be used to install an environment with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After the installation the environment should be visible via `conda info --envs`:

```sh
# conda environments:
#
dsnd-webdev        /usr/local/anaconda3/envs/dsnd-proj3
...

```
